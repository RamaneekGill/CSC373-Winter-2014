Algorithm Design, Analysis, and Complexity
Taught by Francois Pitt at UofT

Standard algorithm design techniques: divide-and-conquer, greedy strategies, dynamic programming, linear programming, randomization, network flows, approximation algorithms.  Brief introduction to NP-completeness: polynomial time reductions, examples of various NP-complete problems, self-reducibility. Students will be expected to show good design principles and adequate skills at reasoning about the correctness and complexity of algorithms.

In this course assignments and problem sets had to be completed using mathematical proofs and many algorithmic techniques.
